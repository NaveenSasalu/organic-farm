That sounds like a fantastic venture! Moving an organic farm into the digital space not only helps with sales but also builds a direct connection between the land and the consumer.

To get us started, I’ve outlined the core **Use Cases** (the "what" the system does) and **User Stories** (the "why" and "how" from the user's perspective).

---

## 1. Core Use Cases

These represent the high-level functions of your platform.

* **User Management:** Registration, login, and profile management (addresses, preferences).
* **Product Cataloging:** Browsing seasonal produce, viewing nutritional info, and stock availability.
* **Order Management:** Adding items to a cart, scheduling delivery/pickup, and tracking order status.
* **Secure Payments:** Processing transactions via cards, digital wallets, or COD.
* **Feedback & Rating:** Users providing reviews on product quality and delivery service.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Managing inventory, updating prices, and viewing sales analytics.

## 2. User Stories

I’ve broken these down by the two primary roles: the **Customer** and the **Farm Admin**.

### For the Customer

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **US.1** | As a customer, I want to **create an account** so that my delivery address and payment methods are saved for future orders. | Email verification; secure password; profile edit screen. |
| **US.2** | As a customer, I want to **filter vegetables by "Seasonal" or "In Stock"** so I don't get disappointed by unavailable items. | Real-time stock status; category filters. |
| **US.3** | As a customer, I want to **track my order in real-time** so I know exactly when my fresh produce will arrive. | Status updates: "Picked," "Out for Delivery," "Delivered." |
| **US.4** | As a customer, I want to **leave a review** after receiving my order to share my experience with the farm. | Star rating system; text comments; photo upload. |

### For the Farm Admin (You)

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **US.5** | As an admin, I want to **update daily inventory** so that customers only buy what is harvested that day. | Easy-to-use toggle for "In Stock" / "Out of Stock." |
| **US.6** | As an admin, I want to **view a daily delivery map** so I can plan the most efficient route for our drivers. | Integration with a map API; list of addresses per day. |

## 3. The Technical Flow

To ensure the app feels seamless, we need to think about the "Happy Path"—the perfect journey from a user landing on the app to a successful delivery.

1. **Discovery:** User opens app -> views high-quality photos of organic kale/tomatoes.
2. **Selection:** User adds to basket -> System checks real-time inventory.
3. **Checkout:** User selects a delivery slot (e.g., "Saturday Morning") -> Payment is authorized.
4. **Fulfillment:** Admin receives the picking list -> Order is packed -> Status updates to "Ready."
5. **Completion:** Delivery is made -> User receives a push notification to rate the freshness.

## Next Steps

To narrow this down into a development plan, we should decide on the **Business Model**:

* **Subscription Model:** (e.g., A weekly "Organic Box" that arrives automatically).
* **On-Demand:** (e.g., Users shop item-by-item whenever they need).

**Would you like me to create a detailed feature list for the Admin Dashboard, or should we start defining the database structure for the products?**
